In addition', ' the choices are also extensive for both types of wood. The two products are equivalent', ' the degradation is similar. The choice is therefore between presenting natural kitchen cabinets or shades. Otherwise', ' you can choose: Still as popular as ever', ' wood is a timeless material found in many kitchens. It is particularly appreciated for the prestigious and warm side it confers on your room. It is a noble material that pleases by its natural and unique look that creates a friendly atmosphere and gives character to yourkitchen. It brings clarity and its combination with other materials such as steel', ' concrete or stone adds an elegant touch to your room. In addition', ' there are a multitude of colors from which you can opt thanks to the quantity of existing wood species', ' each with its own character. From cherry wood to walnut wood', ' white oak and maple', ' each wood offers different colours and characteristics. However', ' keep in mind that although wood is a very strong material', ' it requires minimal maintenance in order to be well preserved and last a long time. Indeed', ' it should be dyed and varnished about once or twice a year. Moreover', ' being a noble and natural material', ' wood represents a high cost. You are charmed by the warm and refined side of the wood but its high price does not match your budget? Polyester is the alternative for you! It perfectly mimics the texture of wood for an aesthetic and refined rendering at a very affordable price. The cabinets consist of a central melamine panel and are wrapped in polyester which makes them stronger than simply melamine cabinets. Polyester is a robust material that has good resistance to shocks but also to heat and humidity. It also offers many possibilities for personalization thanks to the many shades available as well as a choice of finishes such as matte', ' satin or textured. In addition', ' the cabinets do not require special maintenance', ' a simple soap and a sponge are enough to give them back all their luster. However', ' be aware that in case of damage the polyester is often difficult to repair. The melamine cabinets we experienced in the 1980s have nothing to do with those we make today. Indeed', ' the old white cabinets have disappeared to make way for modern and trendy cabinets. If melamine was perceived as a low-end material', ' things have changed. Having become a very popular material', ' melamine is very often used in themanufactureof kitchen cabinets. It’s a popular material', ' especially for the wide variety of colours and finishes it offers', ' leaving endless possibilities to customize your cabinets and adapt them to the style of your kitchen. Melamine also offers a nice imitation of wood at a much cheaper price. It is also very easy to maintain', ' a simple wet cloth with a soft soap are enough to give it back all its luster. However', ' melamine is a material that is not very resistant to shocks and scratches and is very sensitive to heat and humidity. So be careful when you take your dishes out of the oven so you don’t leave a trace on your kitchen cabinets. Also make sure you have an efficient kitchen hood so you don’t create too much moisture in your room. In addition', ' melamine is a difficult material to repair', ' so it is necessary to take care of it. Thermoplastic', ' recently renamed the polymer', ' is a material straight from Europe. It offers both an urban and contemporary design look and gives a sophisticated and elegant atmosphere to your kitchen. Thekitchen cabinets in thermoplasticare particularly appreciated for the quality of the materials that make them solid but also refined. Thermoplastic is also a good alternative to wood', ' if you don’t have the necessary budget but you’re still looking to have a nice visual appearance.

In addition', ' it is very resistant to shocks and scratches and maintains a uniform colour that does not degrade over time. To maintain it', ' nothing easier!
